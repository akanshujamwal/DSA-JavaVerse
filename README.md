# DSA-JavaVerse

**An open-source universe of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java.**  
From **fundamentals like arrays and linked lists** to **advanced concepts like graphs, dynamic programming, and optimization techniques**, DSA-JavaVerse is your go-to hub for **clean, beginner-friendly, and well-documented solutions**.

---

## Introduction
Welcome to **DSA-JavaVerse**!  
This repository is designed for:
- Developers learning **Java + DSA** from scratch  
- Students preparing for **coding interviews**  
- Competitive programmers looking for optimized solutions  
- Open-source contributors passionate about algorithms  

Our goal is to create a structured and collaborative space to explore, learn, and master **Data Structures and Algorithms** in **Java**.
